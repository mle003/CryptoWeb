## How to run the project

run these commands in the terminal

* Install package: yarn
* Run in local host: yarn start
* Deploy: yarn deploy

Currently, I do not have github pro so I cannot deploy this app since I already deploy my personal website



## Questionnaire:

1. An sub-optimal choice could be create a back-end server and using socket io to call api instead of using websocket to call the api from third party

2. I do not focusing on designing in this assignment, I just use tailwind library for simple styling.

3. Currently, I believe that my implementation can run perfectly in low traffic. It just depend on third party api

4. I planned a real-time chart to display how the price change in a period of time but it seems to be out of scope for this assignment. I will implement the chart if I had more time
